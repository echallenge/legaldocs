## CAMILA REMALEY

My name is Camila Remaley, I have been a member of RChain since 2018, and I was born and raised in Chile.  I am currently employed by New Venture Fund as the Operations Manager for TheDream.US, which is the nation's largest college access and success program for immigrant youth.  I completed my Bachelor of Science degree in Accounting, with a minor in Business Administration at Trinity W. University, graduating Magna Cum Laude.  I continued my education at Fitchburg State University, where I received my Master’s degree with a concentration in Management.  I am an experienced professional and I have worked at large financial firms as an accountant and as a financial associate providing counsel to clients, regarding securities and financial decisions.  During that time, I got registered with the SEC and acquired the series 6 and 63. (SS)

I have over 10 years of experience, which includes banking, accounting, financial operations, and relationship management.  I can provide RChain with the financial and operational experience that my career has given me.  My diverse background and passion for innovative and ground-breaking ideas can offer a distinct perspective to the board.

I would like the opportunity to step forward and represent other women in a market highly dominated by men, by providing my skills and academic background as the first woman on the Board of Directors of RChain.  My sole purpose as a board member would be to look out for the co-op’s (and members') best interest, and like many other members, I want to be part of RChain’s success.

I’m Kane Luo, a specialist of sales and marketing with 10 years experience. I worked for an No.1 company in industry and led the regional business revenue to grow from $3 million to $75 million within 5 years. I’m founder of Eomvision, an AI technology company provides vision solutions for Internet of Things. 

I knew Rchain since 2017 and kept tracking the progress what Rchain made. As of the technology achievement made recently, I believe it’s supposed to be the right timing for Rchain to stand out, get market and people to re-cognition the technologies, and the value Rchain offers. I’m a very strong believer on Rchain technology and great vision, in the meanwhile, I also believe we need enhance marketing now to let more people know more about Rchain. 

With my successful sales and marketing experience, I will be firstly focusing on China market which potentially is the biggest market, and structurally rebuilding brand awareness including but not limited on AMAs/roadshows/meetups/medias/and so on. Based on Rchain’s unique technology advantages, we need differentiate ourselves from other public chains to have right marketing positioning. 

I will also focus on business development. Making an analysis in current market to decide which vertical market could be entry point for Rchain, Gaming/DeFi/CDN/Music/NFT/or others? Once this is clear, create incentives in different ways to attract accordingly Dapp developers to build. Making the first excellent Dapp reference with wide users will be my top task. 

I hope you will vote me to be board director to serve in Rchain Cooperative. I look forward to bringing such great technology to people. Thank you!
